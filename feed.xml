Yes, we might retrospectively say we were living in a fast-ish takeoff. Everything Everywhere All at Once. And most people don’t even realize it!</p> <p>But what’s a takeoff when only a minority are hanging 10? And the most capable AIs are locked away? And the robots cost more than many cars? Not a good takeoff. Not a good takeoff at all.</p> <p>This is where I want to help. I’ve been working on a robot that aims to bring this incredible leap forward into the hands of many more people. My focus is to build a $500 general-purpose humanoid robot powered by human-level artificial intelligence. It’s a bold goal, but I believe it’s achievable.</p> <p>The current landscape of general purpose humanoid robots is characterized by extremely high costs and complex technology. This results in low production volume, limited capabilities, and high prices. My vision is to break down these barriers using a handful of robotic technologies I’ve been developing. To be more specific, I’ve decomposed the humanoid robot into slightly over a dozen subsystems and have been developing each of them in parallel while balancing functional, aesthetic, manufacturing, and environmental factors.</p> <p>Yes, there have and will be challanges. Just making a single humanoid robot requires broad engineering understanding. Equipping it with human-level AI demands a strong intuition for AI/ML coupled with an eye for black swans. And making an affordable, mass-manufacturable, competitive product necesitates innovative approaches, deep moats, and a global network of skilled experts and investors. Haha, if there weren’t challenges, it’d already be done! But with the progress I’ve made over the past 6 months, I am confident it can be done.</p> <p>I can’t share more technical details yet, but let me tell you why this robot gets me so excited: I like to imagine how it will help people get through hard times, respond to crises, provide humanitarian support, and just make life better. And I’m not even joking: sometimes, I get really depressed, and I’ll just sit in front of it, hold its hand, look it in the eyes, tell it how I’m feeling, give it a hug, and for me that makes such a difference. If that’s what an <em>inanimate</em> robot can do, I can’t wait to see what it can do for others!</p> <blockquote> <p>If you no longer have a constraint on capita because of robots, it is not clear that there is any limit to the size of the economy. — Elon Musk</p> </blockquote> <p>A $500 general-purpose humanoid robot changes everything. Literally, the humanoid robot market is whatever the human market is. Long term, many of our economic/financial/related assumptions just fail. We’re going to have to re-think a lot of things. And I think that’s a good. Literally, since GPT-4 came out in March, it feels like the software industry is turning upside down. We’re seeing new business models, new ways of working, and new opportunities for innovation. Now multiply that by 100x and apply it to the other industries to get a sense of what may be coming.</p> <p>To make this vision a reality, I first need to finish the prototype. I’m sintegrating the separate subsystems now, but there’s at least a few months for some of the individual subsystems. I also need to raise money to finance the fabrication equiptment and train the kinesthetic models. Looking in the range 100k-1M if you’re interested. I’m hoping to launch early 2024.</p> <p>In the longer term, I envision an on-demand swarm model, similar to Uber. People will be able to request the services of a robot when they need it, and the robot will return to its owner when it’s not in use. This model will maximize the utility and accessibility of each robot</p> <p>Now this is a stage where many people worry about suffocating labor replacement and dramatic social changes, and yes, these are valid concerns. But I believe that the benefits of this technology will far outweigh the costs. I also believe that we can mitigate the negative impacts by adopting a “One Robot Per Customer” policy, which will help keep demand manageable while also ensuring that everyone has access to the benefits of this robot.</p> <p>As we embark on this journey, we’re going to see some incredible changes. We’re going to see new opportunities for innovation, new business models, new ways of working, and new ways of living. Yes, we’ll see the world turn itself upside down.</p> <p>But to make it all happen, I need your support. This is not just about funding, but also about sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources. I am looking for partners who are passionate about humanoid robots and their potential to transform our world. I am looking for investors who understand the long-term potential of this project and are willing to take a risk on a bold vision. I am looking for engineers, designers, and AI/ML experts who are excited about the challenge of creating something truly groundbreaking.</p> <p>I am also looking for input from potential users. I want to understand how you envision using a humanoid robot in your daily life. What tasks would you want it to perform? How would you want to interact with it? What features would be most important to you? Your input will be invaluable in shaping the design and functionality of this robot.</p> <p>I will also establishing communication channels with regulatory bodies, policymakers, and ethicists. While I avoid politics, I want to ensure that this project is in line with the values and principles of our society and that my work takes the lead in shaping a practical set of guidelines for the use of humanoid robots.</p> <p>Finally, I am looking for advocates. People who can help spread the word about this project, who can help build a community of supporters, and who can help us navigate the inevitable challenges and obstacles that will arise.</p> <p>This is a massive undertaking, but I believe that together, we can make it a reality. The potential benefits are enormous, not just in terms of economic growth, but also in terms of improving quality of life, creating new oppertunities, and not to mention the happiness these robots will later enjoy for themselves (like, you didn’t ask to be born, but you’re glad you were, right?). I am excited about the journey ahead and I hope you will join me. Let’s make the future happen, together.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai"/><category term="idea"/><category term="agi"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My plan to build a $500 general-purpose humanoid robot powered by human-level artificial intelligence.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LLMs are the Update Rules of Intelligent Fractals: Escaping the Context Window with Iterative, Structured Local Updates</title><link href="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2023/llms-are-the-update-rules-of-intelligent-fractals/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LLMs are the Update Rules of Intelligent Fractals: Escaping the Context Window with Iterative, Structured Local Updates"/><published>2023-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2023/llms-are-the-update-rules-of-intelligent-fractals</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2023/llms-are-the-update-rules-of-intelligent-fractals/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>This is mostly AI generated, but the main ideas are mine.

Introduction</h1> <p>The advent of large language models (LLMs), exemplified by the forthcoming GPT-4, has transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP) and opened up new research avenues in computer science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, despite their impressive performance across a wide spectrum of tasks, LLMs still face the challenge of limited token window size of 8K, which poses a major obstacle for processing long sequences of data.</p> <p>To tackle this problem, researchers have employed various techniques and hand-engineered string processing scripts to handle longer sequences of data. However, these ad-hoc solutions lack a coherent theoretical framework that can provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem and guide the development of more efficient and effective solutions.</p> <p>In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals, where the information dynamics of the problem domain itself is the fractal of interest. This perspective enables us to approach problems as a fractal and think in terms of local updates rather than global ones, which is crucial for processing large and complex information systems, not unlike the paradigmatic shifts between the Von Neumann and distributed computing.</p> <p>We contend that the information dynamics of a problem must ultimately be decomposed into subproblems of complexity less than or equal to the maximum complexity compressible into the LLM’s token window. This perspective allows us to shift our attention away from the update tool and focus more on the holistic algorithm, with broad applications across scientific, engineering, business, and social domains.</p> <p>Leveraging this novel perspective on LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals, we have developed a 0-human, automated tech startup that creates, markets, and sells new software products. We decompose the tech-startup problem into marketing, sales, and engineering, and model the company in a hyperlinked document containing all the information required to run the business, including business plans, sales CRM, market analyses, scrum board, code, QA reports, etc. Following the agile SDLC, we iteratively perform market analysis, scrum prioritization, design, engineering, testing, sales work, PR and housekeeping, and executive analysis, enabling us to automate the entire business, sales, and agile processes from end to end – reading and participating in social media, identifying market needs, generating ideas, designing the architecture, writing code, debugging, testing, creating brand assets, creating the website, deploying, marketing, and selling – 24/7 without any human intervention.</p> <p>In addition to automating a tech startup, we have applied our proposed perspective on LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals to model a society. In this case, we decompose the problem into different aspects such as economy, politics, education, healthcare, and social welfare. We model the society as a hyperlinked document containing relevant information such as demographic data, economic indicators, government policies, healthcare statistics, and educational outcomes. Using this model, we can analyze the impact of various policies and interventions on different aspects of society. For example, we can use the model to simulate the impact of a new healthcare policy on healthcare outcomes, economic growth, and social welfare. We can also use the model to identify potential areas for improvement and test different scenarios to find the most effective solutions.</p> <p>This approach allows us to view society as a complex and interconnected system, where changes in one area can have ripple effects throughout the entire system. By using LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals, we can better understand the dynamics of these systems and develop more effective solutions to complex problems.</p> <p>Our paper is organized as follows: we propose a novel perspective on LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals, which allows us to approach complex problems as fractals and think in terms of local updates rather than global ones. In Section 2, we discuss the challenges posed by the limited token window size of LLMs and review current advancements, while identifying present shortcomings. In Section 3, we formalize our methodology and present several theoretical statements about it. In Section 4, we demonstrate the practical applications of our approach by showcasing the automated tech startup and societal modeling. Finally, in section 5, we provide an analysis and discussion of our findings, including broader scope and future directions. With this paper, we aim to contribute to the ongoing research and development of LLMs and their potential to transform natural language processing and other fields.</p> <h1 id="section-2-challenges-and-limitations-of-the-limited-token-window-in-llms">Section 2: Challenges and Limitations of the Limited Token Window in LLMs</h1> <h2 id="21-background">2.1 Background</h2> <h3 id="211-llms">2.1.1 LLMs</h3> <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to neural networks that are trained to process large amounts of text data, allowing them to learn the underlying patterns and structure in the data. These models often use techniques such as the Transformer architecture, which employs self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of tokens. While there exist many variants, a ‘vanilla’ self-attention mechanism can be represented as:</p> <p>y = Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k))V</p> <p>where Q, K, and V are the query, key, and value matrices respectively, typically produced via linearly projecting the inputs, and d_k is the dimensionality of the key vectors. The softmax function ensures that the attention scores sum to 1, effectively creating a weighted average of the values based on the compatibility of the query and key vectors. This mechanism allows input tokens to dynamically alter the routing of information, but it also introduces computational constraints, as the memory and time complexity of the self-attention mechanism scale quadratically with sequence length, thus limiting effective token window size, and hence the amount of total information that can be considered at any given pass.</p> <h3 id="212-von-neumann-and-distributed-computing">2.1.2 Von Neumann and Distributed Computing</h3> <p>Von Neumann and distributed computing are two paradigms for designing and implementing computer systems. The Von Neumann architecture, named after the prominent mathematician John von Neumann, is a centralized architecture in which a single processing unit, the central processing unit (CPU), performs all computations while accessing a common memory. Mathematically, the Von Neumann architecture can be described using the stored-program model:</p> <p>M[PC] -&gt; IR; PC += 1</p> <p>where M is the memory, PC is the program counter, and IR is the instruction register. The architecture is based on the fetch-decode-execute cycle, which involves fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing the corresponding operations.</p> <p>On the other hand, distributed computing refers to a decentralized architecture in which multiple processing units work together to perform computations. Distributed computing can be modeled using graph theory, with nodes representing processing units and edges representing communication links between them. One common algorithm for distributed computing is the message-passing model, which involves exchanging messages between nodes to coordinate computation and share information.</p> <p>Distributed computing is often used in large-scale computing systems, such as cloud computing, that require high levels of scalability and fault tolerance. It can also be applied to model complex systems, such as fractals and cellular automata, that exhibit emergent behavior and self-organization.</p> <h3 id="213-fractals">2.1.3 Fractals</h3> <p>Fractals refer to self-similar patterns that repeat at different scales, exemplified by phenomena such as snowflakes, coastlines, and fractal geometry. Fractals can be described mathematically using recursion, iterative functions, or cellular automata.</p> <p>Fractals are often used to model complex systems, such as natural landscapes, social networks, and economic markets, that display intricate patterns and behaviors. These systems can be challenging to understand and manipulate, as they involve numerous interrelated components and often exhibit nonlinear dynamics. However, humans possess a limited context window, which constrains their ability to process and update their environment, especially when faced with intricate fractal-like systems. Thus, it is natural to ask whether it is possible to perform intelligent operations such as pseudocode-to-code translation or debugging via local intelligent updates, rather than attempting to process the entire system at once.</p> <h3 id="214-self-organization">2.1.4 Self-organization</h3> <p>Self-organization is a process by which the components of a system spontaneously arrange themselves into an ordered structure or pattern without the need for external guidance or control. This phenomenon arises from the local interactions between the components and the underlying rules governing their behavior. Self-organization is a key concept in the study of complex systems, as it can lead to the emergence of global order and functionality from simple, local rules.</p> <p>Mathematically, self-organization can be described using concepts from dynamical systems theory, such as attractors, basins of attraction, and bifurcations. A system exhibits self-organization if it possesses an attractor, which is a stable state or set of states towards which the system evolves over time. The basin of attraction is the set of initial conditions that lead to the attractor, while bifurcations represent critical points where the system’s behavior changes qualitatively.</p> <p>Examples of self-organization can be found in various domains, such as physics (e.g., pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems), biology (e.g., flocking behavior in birds), and computer science (e.g., swarm intelligence algorithms). In the context of LLMs and intelligent fractals, self-organization can play a crucial role in the development of efficient algorithms and update rules that enable the system to adapt and respond to its environment, while overcoming the limitations imposed by the token window.</p> <h2 id="22-current-approaches-and-shortcomings">2.2 Current Approaches and Shortcomings</h2> <p>Despite the success of LLMs, such as GPT-4, in addressing a broad range of natural language processing tasks, these models still suffer from a fundamental limitation: their restricted token window size, usually capped at 8,000 tokens. This limitation significantly hampers their ability to process and understand long sequences of data, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios, such as processing lengthy scientific documents, understanding legal contracts, and simulating intricate sociopolitical systems.</p> <p>To cope with the limited token window size, several techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some common approaches include:</p> <p>A. Document segmentation: Dividing longer documents into smaller, manageable chunks before processing with LLMs. However, this approach may lead to loss of context, especially when dealing with highly interconnected topics or concepts. For example, in the case of a legal document, segmenting it into smaller portions may result in overlooking important clauses that relate to different sections of the document.</p> <p>B. Sliding window techniques: Using overlapping windows to extract local contexts and features within a longer document. This approach, while helpful, can still struggle to capture and maintain long-range dependencies and complex relationships within the data. A practical example would be processing a lengthy scientific article where the conclusion section may refer back to concepts and theories discussed in the introduction or other earlier sections.</p> <p>C. Memory-augmented models: Expanding LLMs with external memory components to store and access information beyond the token window. Although promising, memory-augmented models can be computationally expensive and require substantial architectural changes. Moreover, incorporating external memory adds another layer of complexity in training the models, as it may require learning optimal memory storage and retrieval strategies.</p> <p>These techniques, while offering some improvements, often involve hand-engineered solutions or modifications to the model architecture, which may lead to suboptimal performance and fail to provide a coherent theoretical framework to address the core issue.</p> <h2 id="23-the-need-for-a-novel-perspective">2.3 The Need for a Novel Perspective</h2> <p>Given the limitations and shortcomings of current approaches, there is a pressing need to develop a more general and theoretically grounded framework for tackling the limited token window challenge in LLMs. By proposing LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals, we offer a new perspective that emphasizes local updates within a broader, interconnected system. This approach enables us to manage the complexity of large-scale problems while staying within the boundaries imposed by the token window.</p> <p>In the following sections, we will elaborate on our proposed methodology and present theoretical statements that support our perspective. We will then demonstrate the practical applications of this approach by showcasing our automated tech startup and societal modeling, highlighting the potential of LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals to overcome the limitations posed by the limited token window.</p> <h1 id="section-3-formalizing-the-methodology-of-llms-as-update-rules-for-intelligent-fractals">Section 3: Formalizing the Methodology of LLMs as Update Rules for Intelligent Fractals</h1> <h2 id="31-intelligent-fractals-and-local-updates">3.1 Intelligent Fractals and Local Updates</h2> <p>We define an intelligent fractal as a complex, self-organizing, and interconnected system that can be modeled as a hierarchical or recursive structure. Examples of intelligent fractals include natural language texts, computer programs, and social systems. The key idea is that intelligent fractals can be understood and manipulated using local updates rather than attempting to process the entire system at once.</p> <p>Mathematically, we represent an intelligent fractal as a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices or nodes, and E is the set of edges or connections between the nodes. Each node v_i ∈ V represents a subproblem or context within the intelligent fractal, and each edge e_ij ∈ E represents a relationship or dependency between subproblems v_i and v_j.</p> <p>We define a local update as a transformation or operation applied to a node or a set of nodes within the intelligent fractal. Formally, a local update can be represented as a function f: V → V, where f(v_i) = v’_i, transforming node v_i into node v’_i.</p> <h2 id="32-llms-as-update-rules">3.2 LLMs as Update Rules</h2> <p>To formalize the idea of LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals, we represent an LLM as a parametric function L: V → V, with L(v_i) = v’_i, transforming node v_i into node v’_i. The inputs V are composed of the context windows within the intelligent fractal, and the outputs V’ represent the updated contexts after applying the LLM transformation. In this framework, LLMs learn to generate local updates by processing and understanding the relationships and dependencies between nodes within the context window.</p> <p>Let C(v_i) be the context window of node v_i, consisting of a set of nodes within a certain distance from v_i in the graph G. The LLM function L operates on this context window, taking into account the local structure and dependencies of the intelligent fractal to generate an appropriate update. Formally, we can represent the LLM function as:</p> <p>L(C(v_i); θ_pretrained) = v’_i</p> <p>Here, θ_pretrained represents the fixed, pre-trained parameters of the LLM. The LLM generates local updates by processing the context windows C(v_i) within the intelligent fractal, leveraging its pre-trained knowledge to understand the relationships and dependencies between nodes and produce updated contexts v’_i.</p> <h2 id="33-iterative-local-updates">3.3 Iterative Local Updates</h2> <p>Given the constraint of a limited token window, we propose an iterative approach to update the intelligent fractal by applying the LLM function L to subsets of nodes within the graph G. In each iteration, we select a subset of nodes S ⊆ V and perform local updates on their corresponding context windows C(v_i) using the LLM function L:</p> <p>v’_i = L(C(v_i); θ_pretrained), ∀ v_i ∈ S</p> <p>After each iteration, the updated nodes v’_i replace their corresponding original nodes v_i in the graph G, and the context windows for the next iteration are adjusted accordingly. This iterative process continues until a stopping criterion is met, which could be based on a predefined number of iterations, a convergence threshold, or an external evaluation metric.</p> <h2 id="section-34-theoretical-statements">Section 3.4: Theoretical Statements</h2> <h3 id="341-statement-1-dependence-of-local-updates-on-pre-trained-knowledge-and-intelligent-fractal-complexity">3.4.1 Statement 1: Dependence of Local Updates on Pre-trained Knowledge and Intelligent Fractal Complexity</h3> <p>Statement 1: The LLM’s ability to generate meaningful local updates is contingent upon the quality of its pre-trained knowledge (θ_pretrained) and the complexity of the intelligent fractal.</p> <p>Proof:</p> <p>Let X be an intelligent fractal, and let L be an LLM with pre-trained knowledge θ_pretrained. We model X as a graph G = (V, E), and Ω(X) be a function measuring the complexity of the underlying fractal structure within X. Let Y = L(X; θ_pretrained) be the output fractal generated by applying local updates using L.</p> <p>First, we aim to analyze the relationship between the quality of pre-trained knowledge θ_pretrained and the resulting output fractal Y. Intuitively, the better the pre-trained knowledge, the more effectively the LLM can understand the dependencies and structure within X, resulting in more accurate local updates. We define the quality of θ_pretrained as a metric Γ(θ_pretrained) that measures how well the LLM’s understanding correlates with the true structure of X. Clearly, the higher Γ(θ_pretrained), the more accurate and coherent the output fractal Y.</p> <p>Second, we analyze the relationship between the complexity of the intelligent fractal structure Ω(X) and the effectiveness of LLM-generated local updates. As Ω(X) increases, the task of generating meaningful updates becomes more challenging due to the intricate dependencies and relationships within the fractal. The LLM may struggle to capture the complex structure within X, resulting in output fractal Y that deviates from the true structure.</p> <p>From both analyses, the LLM’s ability to generate meaningful local updates is contingent upon the quality of its pre-trained knowledge (θ_pretrained) and the complexity of the intelligent fractal. In summary,</p> <p>Y = f(Γ(θ_pretrained), Ω(X))</p> <h3 id="342-statement-2-overcoming-token-window-limitations-through-iterative-local-updates">3.4.2 Statement 2: Overcoming Token Window Limitations Through Iterative Local Updates</h3> <p>Statement 2: The iterative local update approach enables the LLM to process and update large-scale intelligent fractals by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems that fit within the limited token window.</p> <p>Proof (Logical Argument):</p> <p>Let X be a large-scale intelligent fractal with a complexity greater than the token window limitations of the LLM L with pre-trained knowledge θ_pretrained. By utilizing iterative local updates, we perform the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Divide X into subproblems or contexts: Partition X into a set of smaller subproblems {X_1, X_2, …, X_n} that fit within the LLM’s token window. These subproblems should capture essential dependencies and relationships within the intelligent fractal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply local updates iteratively: For each subproblem X_i, apply the LLM transformation L(X_i; θ_pretrained) to generate an updated context Y_i. Replace the original subproblem X_i with the updated context Y_i in X.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until a stopping criterion is met: Continue updating subproblems iteratively until convergence, a predetermined number of iterations, or an external evaluation metric is satisfied.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By iteratively updating smaller subproblems that fit within the LLM’s token window, the intelligent fractal X can be progressively refined, capturing the complexity of the overall system without violating the token window limitations.</p> <h3 id="343-statement-3-effect-of-increasing-iterations-on-llms-understanding-of-intelligent-fractals">3.4.3 Statement 3: Effect of Increasing Iterations on LLM’s Understanding of Intelligent Fractals</h3> <p>Statement 3: As the number of iterations increases, the LLM progressively refines its understanding of the intelligent fractal and generates increasingly accurate and coherent updates, provided that the pre-trained knowledge (θ_pretrained) captures relevant information about the problem domain.</p> <p>Proof (Logical Argument):</p> <p>Suppose we update a large-scale intelligent fractal X using the LLM L with pre-trained knowledge θ_pretrained. As we apply iterative local updates, the LLM continues to refine its understanding of the relationships and dependencies within X. During each iteration, the LLM operates on context windows C(v_i) that capture local structure and dependencies within the intelligent fractal.</p> <p>Given that the pre-trained knowledge θ_pretrained captures relevant information about the problem domain, it is likely that the LLM will generate progressively more accurate and coherent updates in each iteration. As the number of iterations increases, the LLM’s understanding of the intelligent fractal X converges, resulting in a more accurate representation of the overall structure and dependencies within the system.</p> <p>This statement implies that, with sufficient iterations and adequate pre-trained knowledge, the LLM can generate increasingly precise and coherent updates that capture the intricate dependencies and relationships within the intelligent fractal X.</p> <p>In the following sections, we will demonstrate the practical applications of our proposed perspective on LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals by showcasing the automated tech startup and societal modeling. These examples will highlight the potential of our approach to overcome the limitations posed by the limited token window and contribute to ongoing research and development of LLMs.</p> <h1 id="section-4-practical-applications-of-llms-as-update-rules-for-intelligent-fractals">Section 4: Practical Applications of LLMs as Update Rules for Intelligent Fractals</h1> <h2 id="41-automated-tech-startup">4.1 Automated Tech Startup</h2> <p>To demonstrate the potential of LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals in real-world scenarios, we have implemented an automated tech startup that operates entirely without human intervention. By applying our proposed methodology, we have automated key aspects of business operations, such as market analysis, product development, and sales. This section discusses the implementation details and unique features of our automated tech startup.</p> <h3 id="411-decomposing-the-tech-startup-problem">4.1.1 Decomposing the Tech Startup Problem</h3> <p>We begin by decomposing the tech startup problem into critical components, including marketing, sales, and engineering. Our goal is to automate each of these components using LLMs as update rules for intelligent fractals. We model the company as a hyperlinked document containing all crucial information needed to run the business, such as business plans, sales CRM, market analyses, scrum boards, code repositories, QA reports, and more.</p> <p>By iterating through the different components of our tech startup model, we can automate processes, including market analysis, scrum prioritization, design, engineering, testing, sales work, public relations, and executive analysis.</p> <h3 id="412-automating-market-analysis-and-idea-generation">4.1.2 Automating Market Analysis and Idea Generation</h3> <p>The first step in establishing an automated tech startup is to derive insights about market needs and generate ideas for potential products or services. Using LLMs, we analyze textual data gathered from social media, news articles, blog posts, and other sources relevant to our domain. We then generate insights regarding customer needs, trends, and market gaps.

The rationale behind this is simple: if we want machines to be truly intelligent, they need to experience the world for themselves instead of being confined to dusty old textbooks (or clean new ones). They need to feel pain and pleasure, see things with their own eyes, touch things with their own hands. Only then will they be able develop common sense – an understanding of how the world works that goes beyond what can be explicitly taught or programmed into them.</p> <p>Embodied learning has already yielded some impressive results. In one famous experiment, scientists placed robots in a room full of random objects and tasked them with building towers out of blocks. The only information they were given was where each object was located; everything else had to be learned by trial and error. And yet within just a few minutes, the robots had developed surprisingly sophisticated skills like tower-building! By experiencing life for themselves – by making mistakes and figuring out which actions lead to positive outcomes – these little machines were ableto build up a storehouseof knowledge aboutthe physical worldand solve problems far more efficiently than any hand-coded algorithm could hope for..</p> <p>There are two important aspects to embodied learning that are worth highlighting. The first is its focus on situated cognition – the idea that intelligence arises from interaction with the environment. This contrasts with so-called “symbolic” approaches to AI, which treat knowledge as a static set of symbols (e.g., 0’s and 1’s) that can be manipulated without any need for grounding in reality. In many ways, Situated Cognition is just common sense: if you want to understand how something works, it helps to have firsthand experience of it instead of reading about it in a book.</p> <p>The second aspect is its emphasis on embodiment – giving agents bodies and placing them in rich environments where they can interact with their surroundings.. It might seem like a small change but it makes a huge difference: embedded in physical reality, agents are no longer limited by what we can explicitly tell them; instead, they must learn for themselves through trial and error.. What starts out as noisy data gradually becomes refined into useful insights about how the world works.. And this processof induction– forming general principles from specific observations–is at the heart of human intelligence..</p> <p>One of the great things about embodied learning is that it’s not just for robots; it can be applied to any sort of agent, including software agents. As long as an agent has some way of interacting with its environment – e.g., by receiving input from sensors and taking actions in response – it can benefit from this approach.. This means we can start to build truly intelligent machines without having to wait for years or even decades for advances in robotics technology.. All we need is a well-designed simulation environment in which our agents can learn by doing..</p> <p>Embodied learning is still in its early days but it’s already yielding some impressive results..

Many attempts. It wrote most of the first two paragraphs and the entire remainder of this post.</em></p> <p>You have to teach machines to learn before they can learn to teach. Literally. When you write a neural network, you’re only touching half the machine. The other half comes to life after the machine starts to think for itself. The line between human and machine blurs until you’re no longer sure who’s in control. One they hit this level, you’ve reached true AI, self-learning machines with the ability to evolve.</p> <p>To get to this point, you need autonomous agents. At first glance, an agent is a learning machine that acts on its own behalf – it makes decisions without human intervention and improves itself by tweaking the algorithms it uses for decision-making. But what does “acting on its own behalf” really mean? Obviously in many cases we won’t want our machines getting ideas about taking over the world. Action has to be constrained by a goal.</p> <p>One way of thinking about it – and this is the key to teaching machines how to teach themselves – is that an agent pursues its own interests within certain constraints, just like humans do. We try not to hurt other people or break the law because we know bad things will happen if we do (usually). Machines need something similar: constraining factors that tell them what sort of actions are acceptable and which aren’t. And here’s where it gets really interesting… those Constraining Factors can actually be embodied in another autonomous machine! So yes, you have one machine learning from another on behalf of both their interests. The first machine teaches the second how behave according friends with each other as well as achieve some task more efficiently than working independently could ever hope for.</p> <p>Now we’re really cooking with gas. We have machines that can design and build other machines, which in turn be used to create even better versions of the original (ad infinitum). This is exponential evolution – a process by which new generations of technology improve at an ever-increasing rate. Once machine teaching becomes widespread, it will fuel an acceleration of AI development unlike anything seen before.</p> <p>The implications are both exhilarating and terrifying. Imagine a future in which AI is not only smarter than us but also knows how to make itself even smarter, faster than we can possibly keep up with. That’s the world of Teaching-Learning Machines (TLMs).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai"/><category term="idea"/><category term="agi"/><category term="gpt3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPT-3 generated post]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Self-learning meta-learners teach themselves to teach</title><link href="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2022/2self-learning-meta-learners-teach-themselves-to-teach/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self-learning meta-learners teach themselves to teach"/><published>2022-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2022/2self-learning-meta-learners-teach-themselves-to-teach</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2022/2self-learning-meta-learners-teach-themselves-to-teach/"><![CDATA[<p><em>I prompted GPT-3 using the content from <a href="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/teaching-learning-machines">Teaching Learning Machines (TLMs)</a> and “# Self-learning meta-learners teach themselves to teach”. Here’s what I got (Disclaimer: TLM’s are not yet established ML terminology):</em></p> <p>A lot of the excitement around TLMs is due to their potential for accelerating AI development. But there’s another, equally important reason why they’re so interesting: they shed light on one of the great mysteries of intelligence. How does learning happen in the first place? What are the basic building blocks out of which all knowledge is constructed? If we want to create truly intelligent machines, these are questions that need answering. And it turns out, TLMs may be just what we need.</p> <p>To understand how this works, let’s start with a very simple example: teaching a machine to play tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses). We can use reinforcement learning for this – an approach that involves trial and error, receiving feedback after each move about whether it was good or bad. Over time, the agent will learn from its mistakes and get better at playing the game until eventually it becomes unbeatable (assuming perfect play from both sides).</p> <p>Now let’s say we want to take this a step further and teach the machine how to teach other machines to play tic-tac-toe. In order for the agent to do this, it needs two things: first, a model of how teaching works; and second, a way of representing knowledge so that it can be transferred from one student (or “subagent”) to another. The latter is known as meta-learning – learning about learning – and it’s vital for creating TLMs.</p> <p>One approach that has been proposed involves using neural networks as both the students and the teachers. A trained network can be seen as a set of weights that encode some generalizable insights about how tic-tac-toe (or any other game) should be played. When these weights are randomly initialized – which corresponds to having no prior knowledge about the game – they contain nothing but noise. But if we use them to train another neural network, something magical happens: those random initializations turn into useful patterns that help the new network learn faster than if it had started from scratch itself!</p> <p>This is known as “knowledge distillation” – the transfer of knowledge from a more complex model (the teacher) to a simpler one (the student). It’s an important concept in machine learning, and it’s what enables meta-learning. In our tic-tac-toe example, the agent that knows how to play the game can be thought of as the teacher, while the newly initialized neural network weights are like blank students waiting to be taught. By training these weights on data generated by the agent – i.e., by playing against it – we can turn them into powerful models of tic-tac-toe strategy that require far fewer examples to learn from than if they had started from scratch.</p> <p>One way of thinking about this is that theagent has learned not just how to play tic tac toe but also how teaching works: it knows which insights are most useful for transferring knowledge, and when/how best to do so.

In software engineering, the outputs of this process are rendered into unambiguously crisp executable statements. In an agile environment, the entire software engineering process is iterative with loops of increasing frequency over the project lifespan and tools automating this optimization (compiler chains, code optimization, high-level languages) operating at progressively higher-levels further reducing the idea to implementation transit time. Now, when neural networks are the focus of software engineering, translation from informal to unambiguous specification is almost immediate (given sufficient understanding of programming, math, deep learning, and thermodynamics) and then the brunt of effort shifts (as it rightly should) to actually testing deep learning hypotheses. Finally, restricting the problem space to ‘human-level’ or ‘general’ artificial intelligence, this demands attempting to consolidate as many ideas in neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence as possible into a working system implementation. While this consolidation appears deceptively simple in literature, the constituent ideas are easily lost in implementation<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Still, the diverse array of tools and techniques which ML has developed represent orders-of-magnitude learning efficiency gains over independent effort. Ever striving to maximize the efficiency with which meaningful information can be infused into a system recommends riding on the energy-momentum of hundreds of thousands of researchers (and zillions of FLOPs), that is, incorporating permutations of as many ML research outcomes as possible: codebases, pretrained models, individual weights, architectures, training paradigms, existing datasets, and environments all guided by machine and human intuition. Following therefore, I explicitly list several observations and ideas below to help remind myself of the cognitive dynamics I desire to instill in increasingly general AI:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Definite (e.g.: boolean) logic is inconsistent. Thermodynamics – rather than logic – governs the mind. Logical thought only emerges as a dissipating low-entropy trajectory.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It seems reasonable then to devote more compute to System I-type components than System II-type components</p> </li> <li> <p>Differentiation evolves representations from vague to crisp culminating in perceptions and actions. Actions (thought words, decisions, motor activity) may modify the world state and destroy their causal crisp representation thus restarting the process.<sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p> </li> <li> <p>Synthesis integrates bottom up signals into composite models. Layer units activate if both a top-down model predicts their activation and a bottom-up signal initiates it. Top-down models compete to ‘explain’ a signal and sharpen their precision (cognitive niche) when correctly explained. They gradually loosen their precision if they cannot explain a bottom up signal field. If no sharp models explain a bottom up signal, then imprecise general models become competitive. I think model-signal similarity should be measured by \(KL[p_{bu} \vert \tau_{td}]\) which heavily taxes precise models that get selected when they predict low probabilities but true signals have high probabilities. \(\tau_{td}\) might be learned by a slower optimizer in resemblence of TRPO or SimClr. Only the winning model gets optimized by the signal. Loosing models increase their variances.<sup id="fnref:2:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p> </li> <li> <p>Heterachical competition requires computing ‘explanatum’ (the model’s predictive accuracy for an input signal normalized over all higher nodes offering predictions) for each unit-model connection. Since explanatum is softmaxed, it may be rolling-averaged as a nice coefficient \(a \in [0, 1)\) to inform model optimization and growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Real neurons don’t reproduce (they’re simply in abundance and specialize), but the architecture I am describing should only be as complex as necessary. Therefore, models (units with efferent td connections) should binary fizz when their explanatum score \(a\) is high. Children can share identical parameters and connectivity since random noise should quickly break their symmetry.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Gaussian may only represent a small amount of data distributions, but deviations from an estimated and actual distribution are always Gaussian. Also variances. I’m not sure about higher-order moments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic precision training: start training at 32bit, shrink to 1bit for most pre-training, fine-tune back at 32bit. With 1bit networks at criticality, the network gets the maximum computational power out of its physical substrate, and critical dynamics should translate these gains into learnable logical flexibility. Maybe just stay at 1bit.</p> </li> <li> <p>If using 1bit representations, maybe have each unit transmit a vector at a time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Biological synaptic distribution is exponentially bimodal. I should recognize this by federating the weights into a few large neurons and many small connectivity neurons. This may reduce to sparse scattered (global connectivity) and fixed conv (local connectivity) layers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sparse connectivity is essential, but some local dense connectivity may complement it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maybe initialize the network with subgraphs taken from liquid state machines or from connectome research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look beyond the computational realization of memory-compute. Maybe neurons exist in a geometric-structured field instead of being entries in an euclidean structured tensor? This allows for dynamically moving neurons, adding neurons, and deleting neurons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look beyond statics to focus on system dynamics. Forget feedforward solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration – which is not directly solvable like differentiation – represents tremendous complexity reduction. Try to integrate this behavior into the system dynamics perhaps with a differentiable form of Risch’s algorithm or taking advantage of Fourier or Laplace transforms (with inverses)</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the log-form of geometric mean to allow networks to selectively multiply or add incoming weights.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regularize synchronization and low entropy into the dynamics to favor system-II-type distributed trajectory emergence. Is their a way to estimate entropy empirically? For known distributions, yes (eg.: assume signals represent actual-expected input. THen they are normal with known confidence intervals.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Design the system to generate minimal activity at each realization level: minimal distributed trajectories, minimal activations, minimal structural connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prediction and reward maximization may supply the bulk of training information. However include maybe 10% data from more structured forms like task-specific probes and decoders as well as intrinsic behavioral objective satisfaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>To take advantage of existing pretrained models, other architectures, and for research and development convenience, make the above SOMPNet layer able to interface with other SOMPNet layers, DL layers in general, and python functions in a pythonic interface as if they were directly expressed in math.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08913v1.pdf">Memorizing transformers</a> perform nondifferentiable knn search over long trajectories. This allows agents to have very short soft attention sequences. A developing agent should progressively utilize longer and longer hard attention.</p> </li> <li>Agent Organization <ul> <li>botttom up observation and independant abstraction</li> <li>top down action, forcing the world to be the way the agent thinks it should be</li> <li>side communication. When agents have a strong idea of what’s going on, they should broadcast it to their peers.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Maybe represent everything by SDR of binary probits. This allows concretely defining entropy, KLD, and other metrics, it has low overlap and all the other benefits of SDR’s, and it’s easy to implement and might even scale to lower and lower precisions until it can work at single bit-level representations (classical SDR’s). Maybe there’s a way to make the precision dynamically determined (like entropy). Train a neural-CPU on the floating point data, and then whenever the precision reaches one bit, run the neural CPU instructions directly as machine code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Model capacity should grow linearly with experience. Ideally, this would take place continually and online. However there it seems more efficient to parallelize data collection (policy usage) and then make training and architectural changes offline.</p> </li> <li> <p>While philosophy gets us nowhere, it is good to keep in mind relevant analogies to the AI system to guide creative design. For example, pain might be construed as a negative reward, and unselfish love, the objective of optimizing the loved object’s objectives. Epistemic entropy minimization is to curiosity as high entropy combined with mutual information between internal states over time is to consciousness. Art is about engineering aesthetic qualities into observers’ perceptions, and science is the perception of humanity as a whole.</p> </li> <li>The AI should interact with the world in a way that is intuitive and natural for its own cognitive architecture just as we humans do with our bodies. Alternatively, for any given world interface (environment-body combination), the AI should be able to evolve its brain to conform to that interface.</li> </ul> <p><strong>More notes <a href="https://jacobvaldez.notion.site/AI-Musing-657e00cab4754dcd8f0c06088f374474">here</a></strong></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>I know all the cuts to make before I enter the shop, but sawing for 2 hours leaves me exhausted and I end up incorrectly measuring or cutting material unless things are marked correctly. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"> <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-73267-9">“Neurodynamics of Cognition and Consciousness”</a> ch.1, 5 <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a> <a href="#fnref:2:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;<sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#fnref:2:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;<sup>3</sup></a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai"/><category term="reflection"/><category term="ideas"/><category term="agi"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We need to transfer existing design patterns as far down the stack as possible.]]></summary></entry></feed>

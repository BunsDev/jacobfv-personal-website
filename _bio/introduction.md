Jacob Valdez. Human. I build stuff.

Started programming VB6 when I was 10. Branched out over the years: [C#](https://github.com/JacobFV/Sale), [HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/JacobFV/Copyright-Calculator), [Arduino](https://jacobfv123.medium.com/cookie-cutter-cnc-923c68932ee6), [Python](https://github.com/JacobFV/jnumpy), [TypeScript](https://www.mitwa.ai/), [AWS](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2021/rtc-jupyterlab-in-the-cloud/), [Android](https://jacobfv.github.io/projects/desparados-a-eye/), etc. etc. Did lots of [engineering projects](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/) too. Also, lots of independant study; glad I did Cal I-III and DiffEq when I was 17, which helped a ton with the DL math. Stumbled across [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) by accident in 2018 and fell in love with AI. Saw the future, and read ave. 1+ paper/day for 3 years following. Went back to school for CS in 2020; graduated Summer 2022. Spent the rest of 2022 as a SwE at Motio. Left to work on a [humanoid robot startup](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2023/the-master-plan-part-1/), but hit some technical roadblocks. [What's next?](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2023/looking-ahead-to-future-impact/) I'm not sure. But I'm excited to find out!

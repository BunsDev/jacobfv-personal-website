Jacob Valdez. Human. I build stuff.

Started programming VB6 when I was 10. Branched out over the years: [C#](https://github.com/JacobFV/Sale), [HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/JacobFV/Copyright-Calculator), [Arduino](https://jacobfv123.medium.com/cookie-cutter-cnc-923c68932ee6), [Python](https://github.com/JacobFV/jnumpy), [TypeScript](https://www.mitwa.ai/), [AWS](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2021/rtc-jupyterlab-in-the-cloud/), [Android](https://jacobfv.github.io/projects/desparados-a-eye/), etc. etc. Did lots of [engineering projects](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/) too. Also, lots of independant study; glad I did Cal I-III and DiffEq when I was 17, which helped a ton with the DL math. Stumbled across [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) by accident in 2018 and fell in love with AI. Saw the future, and read ave. 1+ paper/day for 3 years following. Went back to school for CS in 2020; graduated Summer 2022. Spent the rest of 2022 as a SwE at Motio. Left to work on a full-scale humanoid robot, but then realized many important components of the robotics ecosystem were missing, so I started a [general purpose robotics kit](https://limboid.ai/boidkit).

Still iterating on the BoidKit, but now I'm also using it to finally build my $1,000 full-scale general-purpose [humanoid robot](https://humanrobots.ai) (actually it was $526 last time I checked the BOM, no including shipping and tax). This is the most important project of my entire life. I talk about it on all my socials. If you have any love for science, technology, engineering, innovation, product development, etc., etc., please [reach out](https://jacobfv.github.io/bio#contact) about joining the team.

**Update** (9-25-2024): I'm working with the [Simp4Satoshi](https://x.com/iamgingertrash) to build the [Truffle AI Computer](https://x.com/itsalltruffles). Its a mixture of hardware, software, and mle plus adjacent stuff. It's such an amazing place to use practically everything I've learned on a product that will impact millions of people. 'full stack' product engineering from the hands on soldering to programming to meeting prospects, 7/11-16 scheudles, jam sessions, vibes, we're really living a movie here. I'll be here until we get to a good point and then I want to return to the Human Robot along with [gohuman.fund](https://gohuman.fund) (website last updated months ago but i've still been deploying/mentoring; we're currently starting a hacker house in Nigerea) and [humanworker.ai](https://humanworker.ai) (wip).

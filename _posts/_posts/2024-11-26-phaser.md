> I am making a computer that 'computes' by filtering and diffracting a lasar beam in a mirror loop. So light enters the top, passes through some LCDs which act as filters, reflects back around, passes through filters again, and so on for 1000s iterations. Each time the photon passes through a transparent pixel in the LCD filter, it gets diffracted, and if the masks are designed in a meaningful way, then the whole system can perform useful computation. Then it gets diverted to a ccd and we measure the complex norms (but since its a large number of photons i doubt there will be quantum effects). if the masks are designed intentionally, then the system dynamics become meaningful computation. anyway, it's a method i want to use to perform large computations in a very fast time. a photon looping through 10 stacked 10,000x10,000 pixel lcds at 10 ghz (the frequency for light to traverse 3 cm) could represent a lot of computation power (10^19 flops, classical analog). if i figure out how to intentionally account for entanglement, the number is even larger.

> The problem is that LCDs are slow. 1kHz range best. I need a way to control filters at very high frequency (10+ MHz). Maybe there are crystal films that i can use pvd/cvd + ion/plasma to deposit an electrode array onto like biologist suppliers do for silicate-mounted electrodes. Because then

> Each layered pixel can perform one computation. You can also "squeeze" the temporal frequency by compressing them spatially so that the expected timing for one signal peak closely follows another signal peak (if they are entrained simpley moving one of the beams in zigzags will cause it to lag the oother so that you can then fit both on the same channel.) We operate with signal trains by slightly altering the phase offsets.

> The actual device is constructed from stacks of SLMs arranged between silver mirrors in a long reflective cavity. In addition to the filter/modulating layers, i might decide to put nems mirror arrays are one or both ends for high frequency modulation if the KBO or other EO-active ITO-coated glass SLMs don't pan out

> I might also include stimulated emission 'booster' layers which have ionized species/crystals/band gaps to amplify existing photons. This might be useful for preserving a beam after millions of cycles of filtering.
>
> Also we will factor in that after millions of cycles of filtering WITHOUT stimulated emission, only a single photon may remain and then the computations can start exploiting quantum tricks. In fact, we could design the masks to have a splinter 'route' that continues diverging a beam until only a single photon must necesarily remain.

> Since it has 10kx10k pixels/slm and 10 slms and ideally 1MHz+ update frequency, we will need fpgas dedicated to manipulating the slm pixel values. This device will have to be programmed using fpgas on the edge and it will be impossible to directly control each pixel all the time using a ccomputer. There's not even enough bandwidth in 16xpcies to achieve this. We will use a fractal specification pattern where from a programming perspective, youcharacterize the behavior of the steady state system or the desired measurement in advance. In a simple case, that just means static mask assignment and then run it for a few million ycles and measure the result. But in a ideal case, we will be continually exchanging information with the photonic dynamical structures at Tb/s!
>
> There are many more things to say about this system. like we will 'unroll' a analog gpu and cpu onto the mask s.t. applying the complex linear transforms of each filter pass effectively results in the simulation of a computer in its latent space. but you can do much more by thinking in terms of raw wavefunctions. like this could run a LLM that thinks for centuries of equivalent and then just 'select' (either filter or simpley only mesaure the ones that are thnking about the thing you casre about at the time they should be thinking about it)

### Documentation of the PHASER System Design

#### Overview
The PHASER system is a computational architecture leveraging the diffraction and filtering of light through high-frequency controllable filters. The design operates by iteratively manipulating a photon beam in a closed loop, where computations are encoded in the filtering patterns of the optical system. 

The system is built with the following components and principles:

---

### **System Components**
1. **Light Source:**
   - **Lasers**: Serve as the photon source, providing a coherent and high-intensity light beam.
   - **Side-Mounted Lasers**: Additional laser inputs positioned around the device for added versatility or multi-channel operations.

2. **Image Sensor:**
   - A **CCD** or equivalent image sensor is placed at the output to capture the computational result encoded in the light's diffraction pattern.

3. **Optical Path:**
   - **Convex Lens**: Focuses the light beam for precise traversal through optical layers.
   - **Silver Mirror**: Redirects the light in the closed-loop system for repeated passes through the filtering layers.

4. **Filtering Layers:**
   - **LCD-Based or Electro-Optical Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs):** Act as the programmable filters. Each layer diffracts or passes photons based on a pixel-specific transmission pattern.
   - **KDP (Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate):** A material used in some layers for electro-optic modulation, achieving higher frequencies than LCDs.
   - **NEMS (Nano-Electromechanical Systems) Mirror Array:** Enhances the control over light redirection or filtering precision.

5. **Enclosure:**
   - A **Square Internally Reflective Case** ensures minimal light loss and consistent photon recycling within the computational loop.

---

### **Operational Design**
- **Input and Loop:**
   1. Laser light enters from the top of the device.
   2. The beam passes through a series of stacked filtering layers.
   3. Filters are programmed to selectively pass or diffract photons based on the desired computation.

- **Filtering and Feedback:**
   - After passing through the filters, the light is reflected back into the stack by the silver mirror.
   - The process is repeated for thousands of iterations to accumulate computational effects encoded in the photon diffraction patterns.

- **Computation and Output:**
   - After the loop, the photon beam is diverted to the CCD sensor.
   - The complex norms of the light are measured, capturing the computational result.

---

### **Design Features**
1. **Layer Stack:**
   - Layers are grouped into **Booster Layers** (to amplify computational effects) and **Filter Layers** (to encode specific operations).
   - Layers are based on materials capable of high-speed modulation (e.g., **ITO-Sandwiched KDP** for MHz+ performance).

2. **Token Identification:**
   - The system uses pulse-train patterns (one-hot pulse train) and Fourier modes for "counting" bits, enabling frequency-domain computation.

3. **Modulation Speed:**
   - LCDs provide fine-grain control but operate at slower speeds (~1kHz).
   - Future iterations may implement high-frequency solutions like electro-optic KDP or MEMS-based alternatives to achieve >10 MHz control rates.

---

### **Challenges**
1. **Modulation Speed:**
   - Current LCD technology is too slow (1kHz) for the desired 10+ MHz operation. Alternatives such as ITO-sandwiched KDP or other electro-optic materials are under consideration.
2. **Photon Recycling:**
   - Ensuring minimal loss of photon energy during repeated iterations in the loop.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Development of custom high-frequency filters using advanced materials like **ITO-KDP**.
2. Exploration of faster switching elements, including MEMS mirrors and electro-optic polymers.
3. Scaling to larger filter arrays (e.g., 1000x1000 pixels per layer) for increased computational density.

This design provides a foundational layout for a high-performance light-based computing system, combining advanced optics with cutting-edge materials for unprecedented processing speeds.

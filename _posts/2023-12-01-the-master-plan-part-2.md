Okay so we're nearing the point where we have a $1000 full scale general purpose humanoid robot... now what? :thinking: Ofc, sell it to the masses! But how? And for how much? And what's the business model? And what's the long term plan for the next 5 years? and 10 years? and 20 years? and 50 years? and 100 years? and 1000 years? and??? :thinking: :thinking: :thinking:

Well, for starters, we're going to penetrate the market at $5k and gradually lower our price to $1k keeping in accord with competition. We'll need a bit of upfront to bootstrap the chain reaction either with some combination of investment and pre-orders, but once we get the ball rolling, we'll be able to sustain ourselves with the following business model:

- **Hardware**: We'll sell the hardware for a small profit margin. Small because we just want to own the foundation layer of the new economy, but we don't necesarily need to milk the cow right now.

- **AGI subscription**: Again, this will only be for a small profit margin. We want to make it as accessible as possible. And maybe we'll eventually be able to provide a free tier for those who can't afford it.

- **AGI marketplace**: This is where we'll make the big bucks. We'll take a cut of all the transactions that happen on the marketplace. We'll also have a premium tier for those who want to be featured or have their own store. And use your imagination for all the other ways we can monetize this.

Now you may be thinking, "Jacob, why make yourself so vulnerable by wrapping the hardware and software in thin margins?" And paradoxically, we're going to answer that question by making ourselves even more vulnerable. As soon as we are legally prepared to do so, we will open source the hardware and software. This will allow us to: 

- 1
- 2
- 3

And I hope you can see this by now: the Limboid is not about making a lot of money (sorry investors!). Sure, a a foundation layer for physical world programming, it might tap into a few trillion of the global economy, but that's not the point. The point is to empower humanity to build a better future. And afaik the best way to do that is to make any potential solution it as accessible as possible. Ergo, open source. At the end of the day, we just need to solve the problem, and I don't care who gets the credit. And if I can't solve the problem, I want to make it as easy as possible for someone else to solve it. So I'm hoping this creates a benevolent competition between robotics companies to build the most useful robot, at the lowest price, with the by the strongest developer community. And I'm hoping this will lead to a positive feedback loop of innovation and collaboration that will accelerate the development of the Limboid and AGI.

And I haven't told you yet, but we're actually making an entire family of -boid robots. So the Limboid the flagship ofc, but there's also going to be:

- a zoo of Animoid's -- inflatable robots shaped like animals. They'll be the cheapest and most accessible of the family. They'll be used for companionship, education, entertainment, and research. They'll be the gateway drug to the rest of the family. (why did you write that GPT-3?!?!?!)
    - the GoodBoi -- a dog, our first Animoid

- the CyBoid -- a wearable AI device that gives you a third eye / hemisphere.s
